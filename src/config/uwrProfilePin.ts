/**
 * UWR profile pin — PR-UWR-STAMP (afi-governance/decisions/uwr-profile-pin-v0.1.md §7),
 * amended by PR-UWR-STAMP-SEMANTICS (uwr-runtime-consumption-v0.1.md §7 row
 * flipped by owner merge of afi-governance PR #13, merge commit 6b3638b) and
 * generalized to REGISTRY-BACKED recognition by FCP-GOV
 * (decisions/factory-configurable-pipelines-v1.md §14 / D-FCP-9 item 5): the
 * former froggy-only pinned scorer-identity gate is replaced by recognition
 * through the resolved analyst-strategy REGISTRATION — a stamp is issued iff
 * the registration's `uwrProfileRef` names a registered profile AND the
 * scorer identity triple matches the registration. Recognition stays "always
 * registered and pinned, never silent" (UP-10 generalized into D-FCP-5).
 *
 * HARDCODED pinned profile metadata, deliberately (values UNCHANGED from
 * PR-UWR-STAMP). This module does NOT read the afi-config uwr-profiles
 * registry at runtime — the single authorized reader is
 * src/config/uwrRuntimeProfile.ts (RC-7 grant 1). The registration handed in
 * comes from the boot-validated strategy registries (validateRuntimeConfig
 * verifies every active registration's uwrProfileRef against the pinned
 * recognized profile), so recognition is registry-backed without a second
 * registry read path. The stamp records which governed profile the scoring
 * configuration corresponds to, and (RC-6) HOW that configuration was
 * sourced:
 *
 * - resolved source "builtin"  → stamp source "builtin-value-identity":
 *   scoring ran afi-core's `defaultUwrConfig`, value-identical to the
 *   registered profile by construction (UP-2/UP-5); the registry was not read.
 * - resolved source "registry" → stamp source "registry-consumed": scoring
 *   ran the profile actually read from the afi-config registry and validated
 *   under the RC-5 identity predicate. Because resolution is fail-closed
 *   (RC-4), a "registry" source can only ever reach this module after a
 *   successful read + validation — a failed resolution throws before any
 *   scoring, so no record (and no stamp) exists to mislead.
 *
 * The resolved source MUST be propagated here explicitly from the
 * composition path (ResolvedUwrRuntimeConfig.source). This module never
 * reads process.env and never infers the source independently: an
 * unrecognized/unpropagated source with a stampable identity throws rather
 * than stamping, because omitting the field would masquerade as a
 * pre-program record (RC-6: absence identifies the pre-program era).
 *
 * Status: testnet-provisional. Stamping is traceability metadata only —
 * it does not wire the qualification gate (UP-9), does not create reward
 * eligibility or mint wiring (§6), and does not promote production scoring
 * law. A test-only cross-check against the sibling afi-config registry lives
 * in test/guardrails/uwrProfileStamp.test.ts.
